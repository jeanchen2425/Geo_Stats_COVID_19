# Geo_Stats_COVID_19
Used poisson regression model on UK health data to investigate whether exposure to ambient air pollution makes individuals more susceptible to COVID-19. 

With poisson regression model on UK health data, we investigated: 
* whether exposure to ambient air pollution makes individuals more susceptibleto COVID-19.
* whether high unemployment areas tend to have high deprivation and low access to health care.
* whether ethnic minorities have more COVID-19, which has been documented in many countries. 
  These include ethnic minorities being more likely tolive in large, multi-generational households, work in high-risk occupations.

## Implementation Highlights
* Utilized the ‘mapmisc’ library to visualize the correlation of COVID-19 cases density and geographic distribution of air pollution on UK maps.
